## Vision Chain Roadmap

Vision Chain is a modular blockchain protocol powered by a future forward scalability framework with seamless interoperability and strong security guarantees. Vision Chain is a network powered by intent centric interaction model. An intent-centric approach focuses on the intentions behind transactions rather than the specific actions to be performed. By focusing on intents, it's possible to design more user-friendly and intention-revealing transaction constructs, facilitating easier understanding and auditing of cross-ecosystem interactions. We are integrating this intent centric model with account abstraction for the creation of generalized transaction templates that can be interpreted and executed by different blockchain protocols, significantly simplifying the complexity of cross-chain and cross-rollup operations.For this purpose, we provide an Intent Centric Wallet supported by account abstraction through a cross chain event ensemble framework. 

Our cross chain, cross rollup interoperability capability will be powered by the innovative implementation of zero knowledge set based aggregation layer. Major highlight of our blockchain protocol will be the proof of visibility consensus which will be powered by zero knowledge range proofs. The visibility proofs will be the combination of proof of range and proofs of randomness integrated in a recursive manner. The proof of visibility will  be ordered using Homomorphic time lock puzzles. Visibility Proofs will be verified by the Fairness based Sequencer Network powered by Single Secret Leader Election.
